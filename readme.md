# What it is
This project is a NodeJS, Express and Sequelize study, using Victor Lima's [Formação Node.JS](https://www.udemy.com/course/formacao-nodejs/) first project as a reference.
<br>
The application was made to grasp on basic concepts for Node.js backend development, as well as Express and Sequelize.
<br>
It is basically a question and answer app, similar to [ASKfm](https://ask.fm/).
